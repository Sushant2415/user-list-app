# User List App – API Data Fetch Project

A simple and clean web application that fetches user data from an external API and displays it on the UI.  
This project demonstrates my understanding of **Async JavaScript**, **API integration**, and **DOM manipulation**.

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Glassmorphism, Gradients)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Fetch API
- Async / Await

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was built to practice and demonstrate:

- How asynchronous JavaScript works

## 🧠 JavaScript Logic Flow

1. User clicks the **Load Users** button
2. A loading message is shown
3. Data is fetched using `fetch()` with `async/await`
4. API response is converted to JSON
5. User data is displayed dynamically
6. Error message is shown if fetch fails
